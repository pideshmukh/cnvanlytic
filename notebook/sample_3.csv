speaker,utterance,start_time,end_time
A,Okay.,5.57,5.94
A,Does anyone want to see uh Steve's feedback from the specification?,11.09,15.53
D,I I dry-read it the last Right.,17.08,19.26
D,time.,19.41,19.61
D,.,19.61,19.61
A,"Not really , um just what he's talking about like , duplication of effort and Like duplication of effort and stuff , and um yeah , he was saying that we should maybe uh think about having a prototype for week six which , is next Next week week.",21.41,39.41
A,Yeah.,39.62,39.62
A,.,40.05,40.05
A,So we should probably prioritize our packages.,42.24,47.46
A,Mm.,56.64,56.89
B,Yeah.,78.81,79.13
A,Yeah.,80.02,80.38
B,"Yeah I , mean if we just want to have um some data for the user face could , even be random data Yeah.",84.38,94.23
B,Uh.,94.32,94.32
B,"mm mm Yeah I'm , Yeah.",94.45,110.22
A,Yeah.,121.94,122.14
A,Hmm.,155.48,156.35
A,"Has has anyone actually looked at the Java code for No the , huh.",156.35,160.72
A,?,161.4,161.4
A,Hmm.,161.4,161.69
A,"Yeah I , think so.",186.8,187.52
C,The basic word importance is off-line as well The.,211.33,214.42
C,combined measure might not be if we want to wait what the user has typed in into the search.,215.16,220.58
D,Uh mine's gonna be mostly using the off-line.,222.11,225.38
D,But the actual stuff it's doing will be on-line But.,225.38,227.28
D,"it won't be very um processor intensive or memory intensive I , don't think.",227.38,232.21
A,"Yeah , I I don't know about Hmm the search.",252.27,253.5
A,"functionality , that might be online Depends.",253.72,256.38
A,how it's gonna work.,256.77,257.5
A,Yeah.,265.84,266.2
D,Don't think so.,294.86,295.53
D,Yeah.,297.33,297.64
D,Are we still gonna go for dumping it into a database?,310.94,313.59
D,Are we still gonna dump it into a database?,313.59,315.6
D,"'Cause if we are , I reckon we should all read our classes out of the database.",320.21,324.05
D,It'll be so much easier.,324.05,325.29
D,"Well if we're gonna dump the part of it into a database anyway we , might as well dump all the fields we want into the database , calculate everything from there.",326.69,336.18
D,Then we don't even have to worry that much about the underlying X_M_L_ representation We.,336.18,341.1
D,can just query it.,341.16,342.02
D,"Well if we're gonna do that we , should try and store everything in in an X_M_L_ format as well.",393.66,398.87
D,Yeah.,401.19,401.52
B,Yes.,406.39,406.85
D,Yeah.,408.25,408.56
A,Mm-hmm.,460.98,461.22
B,Hmm yes.,461.27,461.69
B,Hmm.,474.82,475.0
A,"Yeah , that makes sense.",479.62,480.4
D,"Well we don't even need to I'm do that not 'cause , so if we sure got.",494.53,496.47
D,"our information density calculated off-line , so all we do is treat the whole lot as one massive document I.",496.61,502.47
D,mean they'll it's not gonna be so big that we can't load in a information density for every utterance And.,502.55,509.12
D,we can just summarise based on that.,509.23,510.79
B,I I thought we would just have like um one big summary um with all the uh different importance levels um displayed on it.,511.55,522.34
B,"And depending on what our um zoom level is , we just display a part of it.",522.34,528.45
B,And we would have one very big thing off-line And.,531.82,535.94
B,from that we would just select what we are displaying.,536.13,538.59
B,Yes.,542.04,542.85
B,So for example you would um give a high value to those um sequences you want to display in the meeting series summary And.,542.85,552.76
B,you just cut off.,552.91,554.08
B,"That was what I sh I thought I yeah , think you.",566.07,568.37
B,I can thought do it on-line.,568.37,569.03
D,.,569.25,569.25
A,Hmm.,578.29,578.58
D,I don't think there's really much point in doing like that when it's just gonna feed off in the end the information density measure basically And.,578.92,587.16
D,that's all calculated off-line So.,587.34,588.85
D,"what you're really doing is sorting a list , is the p computationally hard part of it.",589.05,594.58
D,"Well like the ideas we're calculating are information density all off-line first for every utterance in the whole corpus right ,?",598.84,606.9
D,"So what you do is you say if you're looking at a series of meetings , you just say well our whole document comprises of all these stuck together And.",606.9,614.97
D,then all you have to do is sort them by j information density Like.,615.18,620.18
D,"maybe weighted with the search terms and , then extract them I.",620.33,623.82
D,"don't think it's too slow to do on-line to , be honest.",623.88,627.46
D,Is that But I think the m difference might be that we want just want to have um the words.,639.26,645.18
B,And that's not so much what he meant with not possibly loading everything was that you m um load all the uh Yeah annotation.,645.18,654.76
B,"stuff , all Hmm.",655.09,655.68
B,"the sound files , all Well on , the utterance level I was thinking So.",655.69,688.29
D,the utterances with the highest like mean information density In.,688.45,692.54
D,"Well the trouble with doing it on the word level is if you want the audio to synch up you've , got no way of getting in and extracting just that word I.",695.7,702.38
D,mean it's impossible.,702.44,703.25
D,For every single word Yeah.,705.89,707.48
D,?,707.82,707.82
D,"Oh , okay.",707.82,708.38
D,Yeah.,710.24,710.5
D,I don't think that will do it We'll.,713.95,715.49
D,have Um to buffer it.,715.63,716.4
B,I r I I'm getting quite lost um at the moment because um w what's um our difference between the um se um uh the importance measure and the skimming I?,717.46,730.59
B,"mean , do we do both or is it the same thing?",730.68,733.42
D,Well the skimming's gonna use the importance.,734.08,736.26
B,Okay.,737.24,737.63
D,But like at So first but it's when just when gonna we be I_D_F_ talk about.,738.45,740.84
B,"summaries you talk about this uh abo about skimming and not about Well mostly skimming yeah ,.",741.41,746.3
B,Yeah.,762.51,762.79
B,"Yeah right , isn't that the skimming Isn't?",766.8,768.99
B,that the skimming?,769.32,770.06
B,"Yeah but , it use the same data.",774.27,775.88
D,Yeah.,777.43,777.74
D,Well the nice thing about that is it will automatically be in sentences.,792.21,795.63
D,Well more or less So.,795.63,797.85
D,"it will make more sense , and if you get just extract words.",798.06,800.46
C,"I'm not quite so what it did you want to do it , i you just wanted to assign Uh I thought about words.",811.59,824.36
C,Mm.,833.96,834.38
B,Yeah.,842.15,842.69
B,A Yeah.,844.33,846.84
B,"And Mm okay , yeah.",855.29,856.12
B,"I , think we also thought about combining that measure with um the measures I get from um s uh hot-spots and so on.",856.13,865.49
B,"So that would also be on utterance level , I think I.",865.49,870.09
B,think I see.,870.22,870.67
D,it.,870.75,870.88
D,But it'll need to be calculated at word level though because otherwise there won't be enough occurrences of the terms to make any meaningful sense.,872.5,880.42
D,Yeah.,884.15,884.44
D,"Yeah , I reckon you can just mean Yeah it over the sentence but , how.",889.74,892.28
C,"about those words which don't carry any meaning at all the , um and uhs and something like that.",892.34,898.75
C,Because if we I think if we should we filter average them.,901.3,903.35
C,"average over over a whole utterance all the words , and there are quite unimportant words in there , but quite important words as well , I think we should just disregard the the Maybe we should have like um a cut-off.",903.58,919.99
D,So it a w word only gets a value if it's above a certain threshold.,919.99,925.27
D,So Okay anything.,925.27,925.95
D,that has less than say nought point five importance gets assigned to zero.,926.02,930.49
C,Alright.,931.05,931.28
D,"Yeah that's , the other th Yeah.",933.33,939.84
D,I think we'll have to buffer the audio But.,958.21,959.98
D,I don't think it will be very hard.,960.46,961.67
D,I think it would be like an hour or two's work.,961.67,963.48
D,Like just build an another f wave file essentially.,966.3,970.45
A,"Yeah you , just concatenate Yeah them together , I mean.",970.6,972.37
D,"I bet there would be packages In memory , yeah.",972.44,977.66
D,So just like unp there's bound to be like a media wave object or something like that And.,977.66,982.5
D,just build one in memory.,982.62,983.99
D,I don't know.,987.31,987.77
D,I have no idea But.,987.77,989.44
D,it must have like classes for dealing with files.,989.53,992.97
D,"And if it has classes for concatenating files , you can do it in memory.",992.97,997.21
D,"So Well what I think I might try and build is basically a class that you just feed it a linked list of um different wave-forms , and it will just string them all together with maybe , I don't know tenth , of a second silence in between each one or something like that.",997.21,1032.62
D,"Normalise it , yeah.",1041.16,1042.28
D,"Oh yeah Yes , yeah , we'll need , sure that.",1072.83,1074.05
D,.,1074.15,1074.15
D,We also really wanna be able to search by who's speaking as well.,1076.21,1079.11
D,"It doesn't matter 'cause , all the calculation's done off-line.",1092.42,1095.29
A,Hmm.,1105.95,1106.27
B,Yes Yeah.,1131.12,1131.48
A,.,1131.77,1131.77
A,It just means it loads on demand.,1134.46,1136.26
A,It only loads when it needs a particular type of file.,1136.26,1141.09
A,Like when it's being accessed.,1141.09,1142.22
A,"Yeah , I think that's the idea , it just loads the particular ones it needs.",1160.76,1164.37
A,But if you were doing a search over the whole corpus you'd have to load them all.,1167.5,1170.23
B,"Yes , right.",1175.4,1176.2
A,Hmm.,1179.19,1179.47
B,"Oops , it does.",1180.82,1181.3
B,So I define baseline and what it loads?,1181.3,1184.41
B,"For example it loads all the utterances and so on but , it doesn't load um the discourse acts and for example not the and what's what else there?",1184.41,1197.76
B,Not the summaries.,1197.76,1199.95
B,It only loads those on demand.,1199.95,1201.72
B,Y you mean that you um basically split up th the big thing into um different summaries.,1255.01,1262.59
B,For example that you have a very um top-level um summary and a separate file for for each level.,1262.59,1273.09
D,That's easy You.,1278.34,1278.92
D,just like create a new X_M_L_ document in memory.,1279.02,1282.49
B,Mm-hmm.,1302.56,1302.84
A,Mm.,1322.74,1322.88
D,"I don't think it's really that much of a problem because if it's too big , what we can do is just well all the off-line stuff doesn't really matter And.",1336.18,1343.51
D,all we can do is just process a bit at a time.,1343.67,1346.73
D,"Like for summarisation , say we wanted a hundred utterances in the summary just , look at the meeting , take the top one hundred utterances in each other meeting.",1346.73,1355.32
D,"If it scores higher than the ones already in the summary so far just , replace them And.",1355.32,1360.99
D,then you only have to process one meeting at a time.,1361.12,1363.09
D,"Okay , so maybe we should build a b store a mean measure for the segments and meetings as well?",1383.44,1390.72
D,And speaker.,1422.98,1425.0
D,Speaker and um topic segmenting we'll need as well.,1425.0,1430.72
D,Yeah.,1432.89,1433.22
D,"Well yeah , and then it'll f preserve the order when it's displayed the Yeah.",1448.4,1455.0
D,Yeah.,1457.08,1457.75
D,"Yeah I , think so.",1466.26,1467.11
A,Hmm.,1490.28,1490.49
A,"Yeah , we do not want it in to develop a little tree display as well for multiple results.",1491.68,1495.21
A,"Yeah , but that'd be quite easy to do.",1497.04,1498.64
A,You just need to find the time stamp.,1503.52,1504.9
A,Yeah.,1510.24,1510.64
A,Yeah.,1549.12,1549.4
D,"So we should basically make our own X_M_L_ document in memory that everyone's um module changes that , rather than the underlying data.",1557.56,1571.62
D,And then have that X_M_L_ uh NITE X_M_L_ document tied to the interface.,1571.62,1576.5
D,"Well , you can make it in a file if you want.",1579.86,1581.69
D,Mm-hmm.,1603.4,1603.72
C,Yeah Yes.,1604.0,1604.72
C,.,1605.26,1605.26
C,But there is no I_D_ for an utterance I think It's.,1620.71,1622.92
C,just for individual words So.,1623.17,1625.41
C,how do we do that then N Uh?,1625.68,1628.02
C,"We no no , it's f for for utterances as well.",1628.02,1630.92
B,"No you're , right Yeah.",1632.56,1633.29
C,I think it's It's.,1633.84,1634.11
C,"just for for one word Yeah , I think So.",1634.42,1639.22
C,we I think have those to segments for each utterance are split up.,1639.55,1642.96
C,Yeah.,1643.27,1643.62
A,Think so.,1644.2,1644.62
A,"Yeah , I'm pretty sure it's already there.",1663.46,1665.4
A,Pretty sure that's already there.,1665.4,1666.38
A,The the utterances are numbered.,1666.38,1668.93
B,"Um Uh I'm not quite sure I , have only seen that the uh the individual words have got an I_D_.",1674.56,1680.0
C,Yeah.,1683.32,1683.96
C,You always could have a look at the time stamps and then take the ones that uh belong together to form an utterance.,1683.96,1692.41
B,"No , I I think we would just take the segments that are already Yeah if , they that are were already , there's it's Yeah easy , there's but it um would this segments be possible file.",1693.8,1701.81
B,Um.,1702.75,1702.75
B,"you know , the Uh X_M_L_ segments yeah.",1703.02,1704.42
A,Hmm.,1704.79,1704.9
C,Okay.,1704.9,1705.05
C,.,1705.23,1705.23
B,Oh.,1707.49,1707.63
B,"That I Yeah don't , I think know so.",1711.24,1712.13
A,.,1712.18,1712.18
D,"They are utterances , aren't they?",1742.75,1744.75
D,"The segments are Ye utterances that's aren't , the impression I get , yeah they?",1744.75,1747.54
D,Yeah.,1747.54,1747.59
D,.,1747.77,1747.77
B,"Yeah that's , um Alright , okay.",1748.2,1751.31
B,Mm-hmm.,1751.33,1751.68
A,Oh.,1752.23,1752.42
B,"There Well there , that's are easy time stamps.",1768.7,1769.88
B,"um for , well segments , um and for th um segments is for example when when you look at the data what , is displayed in one line.",1770.39,1781.28
A,Hmm What.,1783.64,1783.86
B,when when you look at it in the Ye hmm?,1783.99,1786.95
A,Mm.,1787.21,1787.43
D,"Well it's I close think enough so , isn't it Isn't.",1789.52,1790.96
A,Yeah?,1791.01,1791.32
D,"It may uh , not be exact every time , but Um it's a so for sort ex of size um I we're looking I for compared.",1791.32,1795.22
B,it with what I did for the pause um duration extraction Um.,1795.49,1800.27
B,and basically it's uh words that are uttered in a sequence without pauses.,1801.04,1806.52
B,But sometimes um however there are um short pauses in it and they're indicated by square brackets pause or Right.,1806.52,1814.35
B,something in the data.,1814.74,1816.32
B,Um someti uh but uh the annotators decided what was one segment and what wasn't.,1820.55,1826.67
B,"I Yeah think yeah , so.",1836.07,1836.99
B,.,1837.15,1837.15
A,Okay.,1840.72,1841.12
A,"Topics yeah ,.",1850.38,1851.11
A,"Yeah , I think that's the right one.",1858.96,1859.86
A,Hmm Yeah.,1870.8,1871.03
B,"but , um I think for some annotations um an uttera ca utterance can have several um types.",1871.15,1881.91
B,For example for the dialogue acts and so on.,1881.91,1883.84
B,Okay.,1886.55,1887.19
B,"Yeah that , should be Hmm for.",1887.19,1888.25
B,Yeah Mm-hmm.,1891.16,1892.39
B,Should.,1892.39,1892.62
B,"be yeah ,.",1892.65,1892.99
D,Yeah.,1923.49,1923.75
D,But why don't we just write it as a new X_M_L_ file?,1931.62,1934.73
D,Can NITE handle just loading arbitrary uh new like attributes and stuff?,1934.73,1940.41
D,"I mean I , would have thought they'd make it able to.",1941.75,1943.54
D,Yeah.,1944.98,1945.27
D,So why do we need to have two X_M_L_ trees in memory at once?,1949.19,1952.21
D,"The other thing is that would mean we'd be using their parser as well , which means we wouldn't have to parse anything which , be quite nice.",1980.46,1986.8
D,'Cause their parser is probably much faster than anything we've come up with anyway.,1986.8,1990.01
A,Mm.,2026.47,2026.78
D,"Yeah , I mean we can process it in chunks if it gets too big basically.",2051.06,2054.59
D,We can just process it all in chunks if it gets too big to load it into memory.,2054.59,2058.95
A,Hmm.,2059.91,2060.09
D,I think we probably want to store Sorry I.,2082.98,2086.16
D,think we probably want to store um a hierarchical information density as well.,2086.19,2092.3
D,So like an informan mation density score for each meeting and each topic segment 'Cause.,2092.3,2098.2
D,otherwise we'd be recalculating the same thing over and over and over again.,2098.34,2101.45
A,"Yeah , that'd be much more efficient to Yeah do that.",2101.65,2103.21
A,.,2103.35,2103.35
A,Yeah.,2103.35,2103.58
D,And that will obviously make it much easier to display.,2104.99,2108.49
D,"Well it may not for the whole meeting but , like Yeah , exactly.",2111.44,2127.08
D,Yeah.,2130.42,2130.7
D,"Well , we can start off like that.",2144.53,2148.15
D,Well I was gonna start off I've v got sort of half-way through implementing one that does just I_D_F_.,2148.15,2153.46
D,And then just I can change that to work on whatever.,2155.09,2158.63
D,Yeah Hmm.,2169.54,2169.88
D,.,2169.88,2169.88
D,And it should be weighted by stuff like the hot spots and um the key-words in the search and stuff like that.,2171.38,2177.56
A,Hmm.,2188.06,2188.16
D,Did he not say something about named entities So?,2207.6,2209.58
D,I thought he said there wasn't very many.,2210.14,2211.63
D,Yeah.,2213.0,2213.44
C,You s uh you said you are currently in uh implementing the idea What.,2234.77,2240.47
D,Yeah exactly are you.,2240.48,2241.94
D,It's not computing T_F_I_D_F_?,2241.94,2243.0
D,", it's just inverse document Okay frequency.",2243.53,2245.26
D,.,2246.51,2246.51
D,'Cause it's really easy to do basically Okay.,2246.51,2248.75
D,There's.,2249.43,2249.43
D,just like for a baseline really.,2249.68,2251.15
C,Mm-hmm.,2251.36,2251.69
A,"Yeah you're , able to do that in Java yeah ,?",2252.6,2253.92
D,"Well , I'm half-way through.",2254.42,2255.68
D,It's Yeah not working.,2255.68,2255.97
D,"yet but , it will do.",2256.28,2257.61
D,Um yeah.,2262.5,2264.29
D,And then averaging it over the utterances.,2264.29,2266.4
D,But it's not like um related to the corpus at all It's.,2267.85,2270.74
D,just working on an arbitrary text file at the moment.,2270.84,2274.35
D,No.,2277.57,2277.86
A,Huh.,2278.06,2278.18
D,It would be useful to know how everyone's gonna store their things though.,2305.09,2309.7
A,Hmm.,2311.17,2311.49
D,Yeah.,2315.51,2315.88
D,Yeah.,2324.66,2325.62
D,Well I've got like a few hours free Yeah Like.,2325.62,2328.47
A,"I've , after had a this b.",2328.58,2329.36
A,"I've had a look at the the topic segments , how it's stored.",2329.52,2333.93
A,"And then yeah th , those are few per meeting , and it um well , it gives a time stamp and inside each one there's uh the actual like utterance segments.",2333.93,2344.25
A,And the list of them that occurred.,2345.35,2346.93
A,And they're all numbered.,2346.93,2347.74
A,Um so that's where that's stored.,2349.22,2350.76
A,"Yeah so , I guess um if I'm gonna be segmenting it with a L_C_ seg then that's like same format I'd want to um put it back out in so it'd be equivalent.",2358.32,2369.21
A,"Well , like the integration.",2380.72,2382.38
A,"What do you mean integration ,?",2382.38,2383.35
A,Hmm.,2387.76,2388.23
A,I don't know.,2391.48,2391.75
A,I don't think anyone's been allocated to do that yet.,2391.75,2393.71
A,"Yeah yeah ,.",2400.98,2401.36
A,"Yeah definitely ,.",2403.25,2403.8
A,"Hmm yeah ,.",2420.21,2421.11
D,It's the most boring task Mm-hmm.,2428.69,2430.09
C,.,2430.46,2430.46
A,"Yeah Yeah , it c could.",2431.62,2432.18
A,"be difficult , yeah.",2432.34,2433.32
A,Yeah.,2447.6,2447.94
A,Well I guess the important thing is to get the crucial m modules built.,2449.19,2453.71
D,Or at least um Ye yeah.,2454.29,2456.04
D,simple versions of them.,2456.21,2457.27
A,"Yeah and , then Yeah , and then we'll maybe have to prioritize somebody into just integrating it.",2457.6,2465.84
D,"So maybe we should try doing something really simple like , just displaying a whole meeting.",2505.0,2509.62
D,And like just being able to scroll through it or something like that.,2510.87,2513.85
D,Yeah.,2516.04,2516.51
D,Are you free after this?,2537.81,2539.04
D,How about Friday then.,2546.05,2547.23
D,'Cause I'm off all Friday.,2547.23,2548.35
D,Uh Wednesday I've got a nine 'til twelve.,2552.86,2555.51
D,"Yeah nothing , in the afternoon I've.",2561.21,2563.21
D,got nothing in the afternoon So.,2563.36,2564.74
D,Okay So.,2566.55,2567.19
D,you ha yeah.,2567.39,2568.03
D,"Where about , just in Appleton Tower?",2570.84,2572.28
D,Uh I'll be in um the Appleton Tower anyway.,2576.72,2580.02
D,Um well I'll be there from twelve.,2582.34,2585.65
D,"I've got some other stuff that needs done on Matlab so , if you're not there at twelve , I can just work on that.",2585.65,2591.3
D,So Yeah.,2591.3,2593.29
A,Mm-hmm.,2617.16,2617.42
A,"Yeah , I Yeah think , I so.",2627.6,2628.2
C,w I w I would need the raw text pretty soon because I have to find out um how I have to put the segments into bins And.,2628.22,2639.72
C,then yeah Uh yeah.,2639.93,2641.45
A,.,2641.61,2641.61
C,"No , that's not necessary.",2644.41,2646.33
A,Hmm.,2649.27,2649.97
A,"Yeah yeah , Why.",2649.97,2650.47
A,"Jasmine w , I thought you just said that you'd uh looked at extracting the text.",2650.47,2654.92
C,"Yes , I did.",2654.98,2656.29
C,But um I've only just got the notes.,2656.29,2659.1
C,I have to still have uh to order everything by the time Yeah So.,2659.1,2664.28
C,"and you you said you did it in Python yeah ,?",2664.43,2666.69
C,"Yeah , I think it's quite easy Yeah after did , the you use uh b the X_L_ uh X_M_L_ parser Yeah in Python.",2667.14,2672.19
C,Yeah?,2672.19,2672.3
A,Right.,2672.3,2672.67
A,.,2672.79,2672.79
A,"Yeah , sounds pretty So good uh So.",2672.79,2674.36
A,"um 'cause yeah , I , was having a look in it a look at it as well and Mm-hmm I noticed.",2675.59,2678.98
A,the um the speakers are all in that separate file?,2679.2,2683.54
A,So did did you have to combine them all and and then re-order them?,2683.54,2686.47
C,"Yeah b , I uh w that's what I was uh thought.",2686.71,2689.66
C,That Yeah you just.,2689.66,2690.02
C,"combine them and then Ye order yeah , c the time stamps Right accordingly.",2690.39,2693.91
A,Yeah.,2694.14,2694.14
A,"so , that's approach um well I , was going to do.",2694.29,2697.49
A,"So yeah , we may as well collaborate.",2697.49,2699.66
C,Okay.,2699.91,2701.15
C,Um what I found out was that there are quite a lot of things without without s time stamps in the beginning.,2701.15,2708.37
A,In the word files?,2708.61,2709.28
C,"Yeah and , Yes uh X_M_L_ , but that's files Yeah.",2709.98,2712.24
C,", that's just an I_D_ or something.",2712.42,2714.27
C,I don't Yeah know.,2714.27,2714.64
C,"Just , everything numbers that's.",2714.64,2715.54
B,a word has a sti time stamp.,2715.83,2717.66
C,"Yes , but what are the other things that's uh some kind of number?",2718.67,2723.05
C,F maybe the file number or something that is in the beginning.,2723.05,2726.71
C,What is that?,2726.71,2727.29
A,I'm Do not you sure know I?,2728.79,2729.58
A,what you mean.,2729.76,2730.41
C,Um I think there are quite a lot of numbers in the beginning where n there is no time stamp for the numbers.,2730.79,2736.29
C,"It's Think they say um quite a lot of numbers and before that uh , um there's this number Was.",2737.75,2744.76
C,"it Yeah , there i are numbers in the um the W_ tag but , there are no time stamps.",2745.14,2753.13
C,Yeah.,2756.88,2757.4
B,That's at the end That's.,2759.5,2761.42
B,"at the end I , think Yeah , her in , time the beginning.",2761.64,2763.53
C,"as well sometimes I , think Oh right.",2763.76,2766.03
C,At.,2766.1,2766.1
C,"least I saw some Yeah maybe ,.",2766.29,2767.56
B,.,2767.92,2767.92
B,Didn't Yeah have a look.,2769.24,2769.7
B,at our meetings.,2769.82,2770.47
C,Yeah.,2775.29,2775.56
A,Hmm Uh.,2776.36,2776.58
B,I I think it wouldn't as it occurs I mean it would be it occurs in every meeting.,2778.65,2785.07
B,"So And I think it even has uh its own annotation , like digits or something.",2785.07,2794.26
B,So that should be really easy to cut out.,2794.26,2797.56
B,Yeah.,2803.23,2803.87
B,I'm sure.,2803.87,2806.36
C,But what it is it actually that numbers?,2808.36,2810.81
B,"Ah it's just to test the system I , think.",2810.97,2812.96
C,"Okay so , but there So are no time stamps annotated to that.",2813.41,2817.56
C,It's it's quite strange.,2817.56,2818.82
B,Mm they have to read numbers from Uh I didn't have a look at that.,2821.05,2835.66
B,So Hmm.,2835.66,2838.42
C,And also um there are different um combinations of letters.,2844.45,2850.42
C,B_R_E_ and something like that.,2850.42,2852.31
C,Is it everything ordered are the time stamps global or uh are they local at any point?,2852.31,2858.58
A,Mm I thought they were local They to th a particular meeting.,2859.11,2861.95
C,Okay.,2862.65,2863.03
D,Yeah.,2885.1,2885.8
D,I'm just building a dictionary.,2885.8,2887.24
D,"Oh mine's , just gonna use the um hash map one in um Java.",2890.34,2894.96
D,'Cause I'm only gonna do it on small documents It's.,2894.96,2897.25
D,just like bef until the information density is up and running Just.,2897.37,2901.8
D,something to get give me something to work with.,2901.99,2903.68
D,"So it's only gonna use quite small documents you , see to , start with.",2905.84,2909.03
C,"Yeah , it's Rainbow.",2918.23,2919.51
C,It's um I think it's just the dictionary in the first place.,2919.51,2923.65
C,"But Um no , I have to bin it up and so I will only have counts for each each bin or something.",2923.65,2943.73
D,Why does it need to be classified into like different segments?,2944.03,2947.36
C,It's because um Rainbow is a text classification system.,2947.73,2951.05
C,And I think it's not possible to have just one class That's.,2951.05,2956.59
C,the problem.,2956.82,2957.6
D,Can we just fill a second class with junk that we don't care about?,2957.6,2961.13
C,"Maybe we could Like , I don't know , copies of Shakespeare or something Yeah sure.",2961.25,2966.03
C,"you , sure , we could do that , but I don't that makes sense.",2966.25,2969.37
D,"'Cause if what we're looking for is the um frequency statistics I , don't see how that would be changed by the classification.",2969.55,2975.45
C,"If we need just frequencies maybe , we should just calculate them by I the using Perl or something.",2978.15,2986.77
C,I don't know.,2986.77,2987.18
D,Well there maybe another tool available?,2988.28,2990.12
C,"Yeah , it's quite easy to just count and s or sort Yeah them.",2991.38,2994.75
C,by um frequency.,2994.85,2996.56
C,Just using a Perl script.,2998.61,3000.69
C,Is it too big?,3005.49,3006.25
C,Yeah.,3010.52,3011.1
C,Hmm.,3019.58,3020.02
C,I don't know how you how many terms you can handle in Perl.,3026.14,3030.46
C,Mm yeah.,3037.74,3038.08
D,Um I can't remember who's got it.,3045.6,3048.3
D,Might be WordNet.,3048.3,3049.47
D,But one of these big corpuses has a list of stop words that you can download and they're just basically lists of really uninteresting boring words that we could filter out before we do that.,3049.47,3061.37
D,"It's like that's one the papers I read , that's um one things they did right at the beginning is they've got this big s stop-list and they just ignore all of those throughout the experiment.",3064.57,3075.13
D,"Yeah , I it would be useful for me as well.",3091.09,3093.72
D,It uh I think that'd be useful for me as well.,3097.1,3100.59
D,Yeah.,3100.59,3100.95
D,Yeah.,3105.95,3106.31
D,Well all you really wanna do is look into getting some sub-set of the ICSI corpus off the DICE machines.,3115.47,3121.68
D,'Cause I hate working on DICE.,3121.68,3123.09
D,It's awful.,3123.09,3123.79
D,Like so I can use my home machine.,3125.51,3127.28
D,ha has a C_D_ burner though.,3130.15,3132.83
D,has a C_D_ burner.,3132.83,3133.99
D,Yeah.,3149.36,3150.52
D,"The right-hand corner , far right.",3150.52,3152.2
D,Yeah Mm-hmm.,3154.3,3154.59
D,.,3154.62,3154.62
D,How big is it without um the WAV files and stuff?,3170.27,3176.7
D,'Cause I could just say at um going over S_C_P_ one night and just leave it going all night if I had to.,3178.12,3183.69
D,"It's yeah I , mean the wave data are obviously not gonna get off there completely.",3192.9,3198.15
D,Really Oh?,3205.83,3206.7
D,right?,3206.95,3207.2
D,"I'll see if I can S_C_P_ it , I suppose.",3214.76,3217.05
D,I've got a Linux box and a Windows box.,3220.97,3223.45
D,So Broad-band.,3223.45,3226.04
D,Put it on to C_D_ I.,3229.32,3230.99
D,can if I get down I can put to C_D_.,3231.13,3233.1
D,Yeah.,3234.71,3235.05
D,I'm not sure if there's enough space.,3247.17,3249.44
D,Is how much do we get?,3249.44,3250.9
D,Really?,3254.02,3254.96
D,Okay.,3254.96,3255.59
D,"Yeah but , I can do it from that session , can't I You?",3272.48,3274.83
D,can compress it from a remote session and S_C_P_ it from the same session?,3274.9,3279.43
D,Do you think?,3300.26,3300.74
D,Yeah Oh.,3305.85,3306.89
D,"no no , I was thinking of SSHing just into some machine and then just SCPing it from there.",3307.0,3312.8
D,Yeah I.,3317.13,3317.51
D,mean it has to go through the gateway But.,3317.61,3319.03
D,Can you not do that?,3321.34,3322.2
D,"Mm , I see.",3328.32,3328.94
B,Uh th yeah.,3334.44,3335.87
D,Yeah.,3336.22,3336.56
B,'Kay.,3338.26,3338.57
B,"Um I just um wondered so , who's uh then doing um the frequencies on on the words , because I'm I think I will also um I could also make use of it um for the agreement and disagreement thing Because.",3338.57,3358.43
B,"I um I in my outline I talked about um using the um discourse acts first , and um then in the chunks of text I found looking for word patterns and so on So.",3358.79,3376.67
B,um I would for example need the um most freq um frequent words.,3377.14,3384.86
B,"So if you cut off all that I'd , won't be use or Yeah , I I but I need it for my chunks then.",3384.86,3401.74
B,I would You know?,3401.74,3403.84
B,"Yeah , but I'd uh I would like to look at the frequency of words in my um in the regions of text I found out to be interesting.",3406.6,3418.96
B,So So I you wouldn't could just need it.,3418.96,3420.34
B,It it would have to be re-calculated only for my segments.,3420.34,3424.01
D,"But th first , uh how big are the chunks?",3425.03,3427.56
B,Huh?,3428.85,3429.05
D,How big are the chunks you're looking at?,3429.17,3430.95
B,Uh uh mm.,3431.35,3433.75
B,"I think it would be , you know , l as as big at as the hot-spot annotation So quite things small then That's.",3433.75,3443.31
B,"quite small yeah ,.",3443.51,3444.21
D,"So that's , you could just some utterances um.",3444.21,3445.81
D,you could use just Hmm.,3446.26,3446.98
D,the same thing we used to build the big dictionary.,3447.03,3449.7
D,"You just do that on-line 'cause that won't take long to build a little dictionary that big , will it.",3449.7,3457.08
D,I mean just use the same tool that Yes we Yeah.,3457.08,3460.37
D,"use yeah ,.",3460.38,3460.83
D,Yeah.,3460.83,3461.05
B,.,3461.39,3461.39
B,So I would probably just concatenate all my Yeah.,3461.39,3465.21
B,um text chunks and then let's say m I will run over it.,3465.39,3469.04
B,Yes.,3475.13,3475.54
C,"Uh I can get all the raw text but , it has to be ordered still.",3493.64,3497.21
C,"So It doesn't need ordered , no.",3497.21,3502.12
C,"No , it isn't.",3502.32,3502.97
D,Um well that's the t are you using T_F_I_D_F_ for the information density?,3516.67,3522.74
C,"Um it's in what is implemented in Rainbow is information gain and , I'm not quite Alright sure how they okay ,.",3523.39,3529.39
C,calculate that.,3530.23,3530.97
D,"Like 'cause frequency would be useful I , think Yeah.",3532.42,3537.62
D,But.,3537.7,3537.7
D,"um depending on the context the , size , and what we consider a document in the sense of calculating T_F_I_D_F_ is gonna change.",3537.9,3547.92
D,Which might need thinking about.,3550.46,3552.19
C,Uh that's what Rainbow does I.,3563.4,3564.61
C,think you j can just get probabilities for a certain words for each document.,3564.76,3570.77
C,Certain Um we would have to look at that.,3572.06,3578.9
C,Mm-hmm.,3585.58,3586.02
C,Oh.,3587.79,3588.1
D,"I think it would be useful yeah ,.",3599.03,3600.6
D,Well you need the raw frequency as well.,3602.39,3607.4
D,But um you also need how many times things occur within each document.,3607.4,3615.81
D,"And um what we consider a document's gonna depend on our context , I think.",3617.34,3622.73
D,"'Cause if we're looking at the whole lot of meetings we'll , consider each meeting a document in sort of terms of this algorithm.",3622.73,3629.39
D,And if we're viewing like say just a small topic segment you might look at even each utterance as a small document.,3629.39,3638.62
D,"Yeah , but the thing is um It's gonna need some th th thought of how we Actually maybe it doesn't actually matter.",3657.12,3668.26
D,"Maybe if you just do it once at the highest level , it it will be fine.",3668.26,3673.04
D,But I was just thinking it might be difficult to calculate the T_F_I_D_F_ off-line for all the different levels we might want.,3673.04,3681.11
D,"'Cause if we're gonna allow disjoint segments for example , then how are we gonna know what's gonna be in context at any given time?",3681.11,3689.2
D,"But I suppose if you just did it globally , treating a meeting as a document , it'd probably still be work out fine because , you'd only be comparing to ones within the context.",3689.2,3700.25
D,"Uh I don't know , I thought were you gonna use that in the end?",3709.73,3712.58
D,The information density.,3715.4,3716.71
D,"Oh sorry that's , what I mean Like.",3729.4,3730.31
D,"um yeah for , each word or whatever , but across the whole lot is what I mean by highest level Like.",3730.63,3737.31
D,across the whole corpus.,3737.47,3738.57
D,"Yeah , but you'd probably look at each meeting as a document.",3746.73,3749.29
D,Mm possibly.,3766.42,3767.34
C,"Yeah that's , what I thought as well that , you that probably the the topic segment level is the most um informative for the words.",3783.48,3793.52
D,"Are they big enough to get anything meaningful Yeah that's , out the of problem?",3794.42,3797.05
C,.,3797.62,3797.62
C,I don't know.,3797.62,3798.23
D,"Well yeah , that is not it's not an issue You.",3814.21,3815.78
D,just concatenate an X_M_L_ file together but.,3815.9,3818.27
D,we still want to have like a notion of meetings for the user.,3818.43,3822.65
B,"Yes , definitely.",3823.37,3825.56
D,"Yeah , sure.",3830.98,3832.1
D,"Yeah , you just like whatever you want to look at , you just jam together into an X_M_L_ file and that's your meeting , even though bits of it may come from all over the place or whatever.",3832.1,3843.37
D,I mean I don't see why that's really a big problem.,3843.37,3848.03
D,So basically what you're saying is you can take an arbitrary amount of data and process it with the same algorithm It.,3856.98,3862.54
D,doesn't matter conceptually what that data is.,3862.66,3866.26
D,It could be a meeting it.,3866.26,3867.37
D,could be two utterances.,3867.45,3869.27
D,it could be a meeting plus half a meeting from somewhere else.,3869.27,3872.16
D,I don't think it's very difficult though.,3904.71,3906.1
D,"I mean what you do is you just build an X_M_L_ file , and if you want it to get down to the utterances , you'd go to the leaves.",3906.1,3913.38
D,"And then if you wanted the next level up , you'd go to the parents of those and like just go from like the leaves inwards towards the branch to build up things like um you know , when you click on a segment , it's gonna have like words or whatever that are important.",3913.38,3932.13
D,"As long as like the algorithms are designed um with it in mind I , don't think it's a very big problem.",3939.98,3946.05
D,"Well like say you had um like say for a meeting right , you've , got like uh say a hierarchy that looks quite big , like this.",3949.19,3959.2
D,And like the utterances come off of here maybe.,3961.84,3964.19
D,"Then when whatever your algorithm is doing as , long as when you're working with utterances you , go for all the leaves , like then if you need something next up , so like a topic segment , you'd go to here But.",3966.04,3978.29
D,"if you were looking at say this one , so only went like this.",3978.6,3981.81
D,"Right , so you it's same , you'd start with the leaves and , you go oh , I want a topic segment.",3985.18,3989.48
D,So I go one layer up.,3989.48,3990.48
D,"See , and then if you're working with just a topic segment in there , it's the only thing you have to worry about.",3992.16,3998.33
D,"And like each time you want a higher level you , just need to go up the tree.",3998.33,4002.56
D,"And as long as your algorithm respects that , then we can just process any arbitrary X_M_L_ file with whatever hierarchical structure we want.",4002.56,4013.87
D,"A meeting , say , and that would be a topic segment.",4019.3,4021.7
D,"So I think as long as you build an algorithm that respects whatever structure's in the file , rather than imposing its own structure Well no , it doesn't have to be.",4029.92,4049.13
D,But I mean it could be as many nodes as you want.,4051.2,4053.81
D,"Like this one could be deeper maybe , say So.",4053.81,4058.02
D,"then you'd start with all your utterances here , and when you go up to get topic segments you , go to here here here here here here here.",4058.18,4065.82
D,That might be a bit confusing though 'cause you have things on different levels.,4068.0,4070.99
A,Mm is there anything else we should discuss?,4099.41,4101.28
D,Well Wednesday Yeah.,4106.34,4108.43
D,.,4108.84,4108.84
D,Yeah.,4112.56,4112.82
D,So we'll see if we can get like a mini-browser just displays two things synched together of some kind.,4114.85,4121.81
D,Yeah.,4121.81,4122.99
D,Yeah.,4122.99,4123.15
A,"Yeah , should we not have like a group directory or something where we can put all our code in and that kinda thing?",4127.45,4132.95
D,It'd be useful.,4133.69,4134.3
D,I don't know who you see about that though.,4134.3,4135.99
A,Hmm.,4136.63,4136.91
A,I've gotten Mm-hmm mm I.,4149.32,4149.96
D,d have hardly no any idea.,4149.99,4151.03
D,I've probably got a reasonable amount because um everything on my DICE account can actually be deleted 'cause I store it all at home as well.,4153.96,4161.13
A,Hmm.,4162.31,4162.62
D,"Is that guaranteed to stay , the Yeah we , can ask Steve if um we can get space.",4172.82,4179.72
D,Maybe you should send a support form.,4183.21,4184.96
A,"Yeah uh , we could Just do that say.",4185.66,4187.0
D,we want some web space.,4187.12,4188.42
D,Listen to.,4191.06,4192.57
A,"Yeah , I'm sure he had to deal with that last year.",4193.81,4195.69
D,Yeah 'Cause.,4195.87,4196.58
D,that'd be really useful is if we had a big directory Especially.,4196.72,4200.17
D,for transferring stuff.,4200.54,4202.37
D,"Having said that , are we allowed to take a copy of the ICSI corpus Something?",4206.72,4210.48
D,we should probably ask before we do it.,4210.69,4212.3
D,.,4213.943,4213.943
D,Okay.,4217.01,4217.53
D,Okay.,4233.48,4233.9
D,"No me , neither Yeah , right.",4245.27,4247.59
B,Ye.,4249.85,4250.15
C,So M shall we sit together tomorrow then as well?,4252.22,4254.35
C,Uh Yeah.,4254.35,4255.32
C,Okay.,4255.38,4255.76
B,"Um Jasmine uh , um what is um the text you're extracting uh looking like then at the end?",4256.32,4264.31
C,"Um yeah , w , would it be best?",4265.08,4267.6
C,At the moment it's Because it's just um lines I of I think it's actually very similar to what I did for my Mm-hmm.,4267.6,4273.4
B,um speaker um uh extraction and I think I would ch perhaps have to change two lines of codes to get you um for each meeting a file that says fr from um this millisecond to this millisecond there was this sequence of words.,4273.5,4292.44
B,And so on.,4294.13,4294.62
C,Um So that's just changing two lines of code.,4296.13,4300.15
B,And it would give you that.,4300.15,4301.22
B,So Okay.,4301.22,4303.6
C,"So um you'd do you extract the words the , raw text , as well Um?",4303.6,4307.95
C,Uh yeah So.,4307.95,4308.54
B,far I extracted um the dura durations Okay.,4308.75,4312.75
B,But.,4312.75,4312.81
B,it's from the words file So.,4313.17,4314.68
B,I could Mm-hmm just.,4315.05,4315.57
B,um Print contatenate out.,4316.72,4318.53
B,"concatenate um the words instead of the durations , and it should I mean Should be very straight-forward.",4318.95,4332.14
B,I can try to do it and send it to you Okay.,4334.26,4336.92
B,Pe and Okay.,4336.92,4337.34
B,"you that , have a look at it , will it make sense for what you want.",4337.47,4341.02
C,Okay.,4342.8,4343.17
C,So have we already extracted from all the files?,4351.34,4353.82
B,"Yeah uh , p I mean it Yeah I just.",4354.56,4356.39
B,let it run over all the files.,4356.84,4358.61
B,So Did you also order Yes Mm-hmm.,4358.61,4361.81
B,I.,4362.22,4362.22
B,just ordered.,4362.28,4362.98
B,Uh I ordered according to the um starting times Hmm of.,4365.92,4369.57
B,the utterances.,4369.64,4370.29
B,What do you mean by diffe Hmm.,4382.18,4387.68
B,"Yeah I , mean t I I have one what I give you would be one file for each meeting.",4392.71,4398.18
B,"Yeah , not for each meeting series.",4401.57,4403.55
B,I didn't do that yet.,4403.55,4404.4
B,"Yeah , one Hmm group.",4411.33,4412.07
B,", yeah Might.",4412.26,4412.44
D,be funny to see what is summarised the whole corpus as anyway.,4412.57,4419.9
D,I think it'd be very useful But.,4419.9,4421.5
B,"Yeah I , mean there's one series that has just one meeting That sounds good.",4434.05,4439.16
B,.,4439.47,4439.47
B,Yes.,4444.88,4445.71
B,Um the you you the data is of the form you have um three identification letter.,4445.71,4451.31
B,"So B_E_D_ or B_B_D_ or something , and that's always the same group.",4451.31,4456.09
B,"And then after that there's um a number like O_O_ one , O_O_ two.",4456.09,4460.96
B,"So , it's a Yeah , but that's Hmm.",4460.96,4470.99
B,that's really quite easy to see because they're named.,4471.12,4475.28
B,Yes.,4492.11,4493.0
B,"But I I mean as um the start uh start times um start for each meeting at zero , you could just probably just um add the um final second time to the next meeting and so on and just put it all together.",4493.0,4512.2
B,"But then we would have to change um the information about who on which channel it was set um , to by which person it was set.",4512.2,4522.19
B,And that is actually stored in another X_M_L_ document.,4522.19,4525.28
A,Hmm.,4526.22,4526.42
A,"Yeah , that's what I'm gonna need.",4534.72,4536.71
B,"Yeah I , w would then just not print out the um Yes start.",4538.2,4543.44
B,"and end times Yeah it's , just mo.",4543.8,4545.33
A,changing Okay it a bit.,4545.44,4545.94
A,.,4546.03,4546.03
B,"No , it's for every single word.",4550.72,4552.4
D,We can Or just for change every the code single.,4553.72,4554.82
B,utterance.,4554.94,4555.62
B,Yeah Yeah.,4555.62,4555.94
B,", that depends on what you want.",4556.06,4557.25
B,"Yeah but , I do it with Perl , it's just string manipulation So.",4559.6,4562.52
B,I would I mean I would just Sure.,4562.68,4570.03
B,"No I , didn't do a sea no.",4582.42,4584.29
A,"No , but uh that's what M_L_C_ seg does.",4587.11,4589.74
A,It it marks the end of each segment.,4589.74,4592.02
A,Yeah.,4594.57,4594.76
A,Yeah.,4604.13,4604.34
B,And you would want that all in one file for all the corpus?,4606.54,4611.81
B,Or For the series.,4611.81,4615.12
B,"Yeah , I can directly put it into uh just like Oh So.",4620.19,4626.79
B,uh only words um per meeting series.,4627.16,4631.71
A,Yeah.,4636.54,4636.77
A,"Yeah , for me it's better if they're by meeting.",4638.2,4640.33
B,Uh-huh.,4643.75,4644.13
B,Yes.,4648.13,4648.89
B,"Yeah , they will just I will just take I would uh take over the names they have anyway.",4650.4,4656.58
B,"Yeah , yeah.",4661.08,4661.47
B,"Yeah , one series has the um same three starting letters So.",4662.81,4667.07
B,So only words and words and times And.,4669.11,4672.12
C,"Uh you I don't need the times , I just need the words.",4672.23,4675.46
C,"But um Yeah you , Yeah want in , the it right ordered order Yes.",4675.46,4679.19
B,Okay.,4679.46,4679.46
B,.,4680.83,4680.83
B,"Okay , anybody.",4680.83,4682.45
B,Um ord base dot times.,4685.37,4686.88
B,"Yeah , and do you want Yeah , sometimes they're contained in one another.",4688.1,4694.18
B,"So Yeah , that doesn't matter too much Just , I think after th.",4694.18,4697.1
B,mm-hmm 'Kay.,4697.35,4698.8
B,.,4699.1,4699.1
B,Ordered Only.,4700.34,4701.62
B,words.,4702.0,4702.57
A,Then that'll be really easy to do once they've got the raw text.,4715.76,4719.1
A,It's just a case of running the script.,4719.1,4721.32
A,"Yeah , I mean hopefully this week.",4724.85,4726.45
B,"Um and I think um for all the corpus , it's just from I know from other times , it's um nine megami byte to have I mean should be should be similar Is that to it have the That's?",4727.29,4737.89
D,quite words good.,4738.08,4738.55
B,Should.,4739.33,4739.33
B,be.,4739.65,4739.87
B,Na um all the words together um for all the meetings.,4742.16,4745.88
A,Alright.,4746.92,4747.08
B,"That's what I'm guessing that's you , know , um what I because nine mega-byte is what I got for when I said for every um utterance this , is goes from there to there and takes takes seconds.",4749.62,4764.74
A,And we Oh could.,4767.71,4768.97
B,"Yeah , I mean I'm it doing it for all of it.",4768.97,4772.8
B,Doesn't matter.,4772.8,4773.65
D,Yeah.,4781.27,4781.65
B,"Yeah , I mean I hope it will be the same for the words It's.",4790.55,4794.46
B,"just what I I I could just use it with the frequency , I think , until the information density thing's finished.",4794.67,4823.08
D,That would be really useful.,4823.08,4824.19
B,Mm-hmm Hmm.,4824.86,4825.59
B,.,4825.73,4825.73
B,Mm So.,4825.73,4827.05
B,so um I will probably send um just one file of the first meeting um to all those who need it so that you can have a look whether that's what you want.,4828.34,4839.35
C,Mm-hmm.,4839.91,4840.27
B,"Yeah I , mean if it's just for one meeting it's , really not too big.",4844.42,4847.23
B,Yeah.,4849.51,4849.8
C,How long would it take to make the frequency counts with a Java hash table?,4856.57,4863.09
C,Yeah.,4868.2,4868.82
C,"No how , long you would have to program something.",4871.04,4873.98
C,Okay.,4879.8,4880.1
C,Mm.,4886.37,4886.73
C,"Because it's quite easy in Perl as well , it's just a line of code for counting all the words and yeah , it's it's by hashes.",4891.18,4899.73
C,Yeah.,4901.68,4902.05
C,Yeah.,4905.03,4905.27
C,'Kay.,4915.12,4915.39
D,"If you're doing it in Java , could you um serialize the output as well as writing it to a file?",4921.63,4928.03
D,"If you're doing it in Java , could you serialize the um dictionary , yeah , as well as writing it to a file?",4928.03,4934.56
D,It's really easy.,4936.25,4937.52
D,I don't see why it'd be any more massive than the file.,4941.91,4943.99
D,Yeah.,4947.32,4947.73
D,It just saves you parsing the um file representation of it.,4951.16,4956.71
D,And now 'cause I would be using it in Java anyway.,4956.71,4959.51
D,So I'd just be building the data structure again.,4959.51,4961.74
D,"Yeah but , it seems like a bit silly to be parsing it over and over again kinda thing.",4971.86,4976.73
D,I would've thought that um I think all the collections and things implement serializable already.,4987.25,4994.49
D,I think they might do.,4997.18,4998.25
D,Tonight I'll try and um I'll either work some more on uh the T_F_I_D_F_ summarizer or do the audio thing.,5013.02,5021.09
A,Don't know Suppose.,5039.62,5039.92
A,we're just getting on with all our Yeah components.,5040.16,5042.58
A,So.,5043.12,5043.12
D,Do I we have know to demonstrate something next week.,5047.24,5048.83
A,Wa?,5048.83,5048.88
B,What do we have to demonstrate?,5049.55,5050.89
A,Yeah Yeah.,5059.43,5060.09
A,"he , suggested that we could have an uh initial prototype.",5060.21,5062.96
A,"I know , I'd Yeah.",5066.7,5067.55
A,b I'd be surprised if we can get anything working by next week.,5067.65,5072.3
A,Alright.,5081.07,5081.24
D,"Yeah , I know.",5092.34,5093.27
D,I think it's 'cause we had to specify it ourselves that it's not as um like focus the specification of most um work we have to do.,5098.29,5107.97
D,Yeah.,5113.62,5114.09
D,Once we start doing it it will all become more or less obvious I think anyway.,5115.46,5119.5
